# Two-Year Expense Analysis and Forecasting Project

## **Overview**

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of operating and fixed expenses over a two-year period (2025-2026), utilizing both Microsoft Excel and Power BI for data modeling, forecasting, and visualization. The goal is to provide actionable insights into expense trends and support informed decision-making for budgeting and resource allocation.

## **Methodology**

1.  **Data Collection**
    
    *   Collected monthly expense data for a variety of categories, including:
        
        *   Operating Expenses: Salaries, Marketing, Software Subscriptions, Travel Expenses, Utilities (variable), Payroll
            
        *   Fixed Expenses: Rent, Insurance, Utilities (fixed), Loan Payments, Office Supplies
            
    *   Ensured data accuracy and consistency through data validation techniques in Excel.
        
2.  **Trend Analysis**
    
    *   Utilized Excel charts (line charts, and potentially others) to visualize expense trends over time.
        
    *   Identified key drivers of expense growth and seasonal patterns.
        
3.  **Forecasting**
    
    *   Employed Excel's forecasting functions (specifically, the FORECAST function) to project future expenses for key categories like salaries and marketing.
        
    *   Calculated upper and lower confidence bounds to provide a range of potential outcomes.
        
4.  **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**
    
    *   Imported the Excel data into Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
        
    *   Developed visualizations to summarize and present key financial information:
        
        *   Total expense summaries (operating and fixed).
            
        *   Expense allocation charts (pie charts) illustrating the proportion of each expense category.
            
        *   Quarterly expense breakdowns (stacked column charts) showing expense trends over time.
            
        *   Waterfall Charts showing an increase in Salariea and the decrease in Loan payments over the quarters.
            
5.  **Data Modeling (Power BI)**
    
    *   Cleaned and transformed the data, ready for further analysis
        
6.  **Visualization**
    
    *   Developed visually impactful, interactive dashboards for operating and fixed expenses using Power BI.
        
    *   The dashboards summarize critical KPIs such as total expenses, salaries, and marketing costs.
        
    *   Expense allocation charts provide a clear distribution across different expense categories, highlighting areas of significant investment.
        
    *   Quarterly breakdowns allow for trend analysis, showing changes in expenses over time.
        
7.  **Insight Generation**
    
    *   Interpreted the data to provide key insights on trends
        
    *   Waterfall charts showing the Salaries and loan payments.
        

## **Technologies Used**

*   Microsoft Excel
    
*   Power BI
    

## **Key Insights**

*   The dashboards provides a clear overview of expenses, allowing for quick identification of expense reduction opportunities.
    
*   Demonstrated skills in data transformation and the importance of data quality.
    
*   Showcased proficiency in designing and implementing a dynamic, interactive dashboard, and in using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations
    

## **Future Improvements**

*   Expand the analysis to include more data points.
    
*   Incorporate advanced forecasting methods, such as machine learning models, for increased accuracy.
    
*   Integrate data from multiple sources to provide a more holistic view of the company's financials.
    

This project demonstrates a practical approach to financial analysis, providing insights into financial performance using widely adopted software tools and statistical modeling and visualiztion techniques.
