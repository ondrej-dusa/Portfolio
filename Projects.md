## [Value at Risk (VaR) Analysis of AAPL Stock](./Projects/Risk Analysis and Value at Risk (VaR).html)

This project analyzes the Value at Risk (VaR) of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock using historical, parametric, and Monte Carlo methods. 

### Key Steps:
- **Data Collection:** Fetches AAPL stock prices from Yahoo Finance and calculates log returns.
- **VaR Calculation:** Computes historical and parametric VaR at a 95% confidence level.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Generates 10,000 return simulations to estimate risk.
- **Backtesting:** Counts exceptions to evaluate VaR model accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Plots return distribution with VaR thresholds.

Technologies: `R`, `quantmod`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`)

**Key Insight**: A comparative analysis of different risk estimation techniques to assess potential losses.
