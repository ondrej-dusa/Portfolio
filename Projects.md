# Projects

Here you can explore all the project I have been working on during my studies or personal research.

## [1. Two-Year Expense Analysis and Forecasting Project](.Projects/Two-Year Expense Analysis and Forecasting Project.html)

This project analyzes operating and fixed expenses over a two-year period (2025-2026) using Excel to derive key business insights.

### Key Steps:

- **Data Collection:** Compiled monthly expense data across multiple categories (salaries, marketing, rent, etc.)  
- **Trend Analysis:** Identified expense trends and patterns using data visualization and Excel charts.
- **Forecasting:** Projected future expenses using Excel's forecasting functions.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Developed interactive dashboards to summarize and present key financial information.
- **Waterfall Charting:** Showed the Trend in salaries and Loan payments by using Waterfall charts.
    
**Technologies:** `Microsoft Excel`, `Power BI`

**Key Insight:** A comprehensive analysis of operating and fixed expenses to support informed decision-making, planning, and resource allocation.

## [2. Value at Risk (VaR) Analysis of AAPL Stock](./Projects/Risk Analysis and Value at Risk (VaR).html)

This project analyzes the Value at Risk (VaR) of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock using historical, parametric, and Monte Carlo methods. 

### Key Steps:
- **Data Collection:** Fetches AAPL stock prices from Yahoo Finance and calculates log returns.
- **VaR Calculation:** Computes historical and parametric VaR at a 95% confidence level.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Generates 10,000 return simulations to estimate risk.
- **Backtesting:** Counts exceptions to evaluate VaR model accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Plots return distribution with VaR thresholds.

Technologies: `R`, `quantmod`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`

**Key Insight**: A comparative analysis of different risk estimation techniques to assess potential losses.

## [3. Power BI: Coffee & Tea Sales Dashboard 2024](./Projects/Coffee Sales 2024.html)

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing 2024 sales data for a coffee and tea company. It offers insights into product performance, market trends, and profitability drivers.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Aggregation:** Consolidated sales data from various regions and product categories.
- **KPI Visualization:** Designed clear and concise visuals for key metrics (Total Sales, Profit, Marketing Efficiency).
- **Interactive Filtering:** Implemented slicers to allow users to explore product-specific data and regional trends.
- **Geographic Analysis:** Created a map to visualize sales distribution across different locations.
- **Trend Analysis:** Analyzed monthly sales patterns and identify key seasonal fluctuations.

Technologies: `Power BI`, `DAX`, `Data Visualization`

**Key Insight**: Highlights key markets (Central), best-selling products (Colombian Coffee), and overall sales performance trends, enabling data-driven business decisions.

## [4. Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualization of MPG Dataset](./Projects/Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of MPG Dataset.html)

This project explores the MPG dataset through descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to analyze acceleration and other key attributes.

### Key Steps:

- **Data Collection:** Loads and cleans the MPG dataset to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Computes mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and other statistical measures.
- **Histogram Analysis:** Plots acceleration distribution with KDE overlay and statistical annotations.
- **Boxplot & Grouped Histograms:** Visualizes acceleration across different cylinder configurations.  

Technologies: `Python`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`

**Key Insight**: Statistical and visual exploration of vehicle acceleration patterns, highlighting distribution characteristics and differences by engine type.
