I developed a dynamic e-commerce website for Werbea, a health and wellness company specializing in premium supplements.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in creating comprehensive e-commerce solutions that integrate advanced features to support business operations and enhance user experience. And also my critical thinking when it comes to scalability and automatization.
